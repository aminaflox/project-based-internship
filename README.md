# Project title: "Airline Ticket Selling web application"
##### project name: "AirNet"
Project description: 

  As the project's title indicates, this is a web application for searching and booking Airline tickets.
The web application is used to help users to find Airline flights by their preferences. Users will be able
to search flights by providing the next information: current location, destination, departure and return dates,
number of passenger, one-way journey or with the return. As a result, it will return all available flights for the chosen
destination and dates of departure and return, with prices of the flights, and other information related to the flight.
In case, if the user wants to book a flight, the user has to sign in or sign up if the user does not have an account.


#### Technologies used:

PostgreSQL

Why? Because, PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that provides
support to different functions of SQL, and allows you to store large and sophisticated data safely.

Node.js

Why? Because, Node.js is a JavaScript framework used to create server-side web application. And node.js 
is free and open source server environment that provides event-driven and asynchronous features which
makes it lightweight and efficient.

Express

Why? Because, Express is a free web application framework for Node.js. It is easy and quick for creating
efficient and robust API and allows you to define an error handling middleware. Express provides mechanisms
to write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
To create reusable webpage templates we will use Handlebars a templating engine.
